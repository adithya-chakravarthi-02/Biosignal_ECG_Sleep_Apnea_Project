# ECG-Based Sleep Apnea Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning framework for automatic **Sleep Apnea Detection** from single-lead ECG signals using a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. This project leverages physiological signal processing and deep learning techniques to classify ECG recordings as **Normal** or **Sleep Apnea**.

---

## Project Overview

Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep. Early detection is essential to reduce associated cardiovascular and neurological risks.

This project presents an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that:

- Preprocesses ECG signals
- Normalizes physiological data
- Trains a 1D CNN classifier
- Evaluates model performance using multiple metrics
- Visualizes results through ROC analysis and confusion matrices

---

## Key Features

- 1D CNN architecture for ECG classification
- ECG signal normalization and preprocessing
- Binary classification (Normal vs Sleep Apnea)
- Automatic model checkpointing
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping
- ROC Curve and AUC analysis
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Dataset

**Source:** PhysioNet Apnea-ECG Database

The dataset contains ECG recordings collected from subjects during sleep and is widely used for sleep apnea research.

> **Note:** The dataset is **not included** in this repository due to licensing and distribution restrictions.
